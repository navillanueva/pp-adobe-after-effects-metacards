# ADOBE AFTER EFFECT METACARDS

Journal of my progress with after effect designing tool for a personal project involving NFTs.

The idea behind this project is to develop a simple clean "membership card" that users can mint to own and access a private discord group where information surrounding upcoming NFT projects will be shared. This idea seem to be the meta at the moment, and technically is pretty simple to develop.

My initial idea, since as of September of 2022 we are currently in a bear market, was to create a "Bear Pass". 

First design: had to learn how to use this tool, design is pretty sketchy and not clean. I currently own a red ruby crypto.com card and was kind of going for that vibe but miserably failed...

Looks a lot cleaner in black, camera work is a bit sloppy and the "3D" effect of the things in the card doesnt look to clean...
